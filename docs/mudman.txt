Often times this question comes up in most muds, especially new ones
with new IMPs and new staff. I offer my advice to anyone new to this, or
anyone seeking better experiences with their mud. The following are
points and rules everyone should try and follow if they are serious
about maintaining an enjoyable and successful mud.
1.) Define your mud's goals. Is it RP, PK or both? Ooc socials
encouraged? Anything you as an IMP can think of to describe what
direction your mud s going is a must. Post an objectives help file for
imms to read when they first come to apply to build. A good way to let
people know if they'd fit in is to describe where you're going, adn what
they can do to help.  Letting someone build for months and then they
find out they're supposed to be making totally different RP related
areas is a good way to get your builders to leave.  A sense of direction.
 
 2.) Keep imms informed of decisions. Involvement in the communication
field makes them feel welcome.  If you're open to letting other imms and
players give their suggestion, make sure they KNOW they are allowed and
encouraged to do so. Making them feel like they have a direct impact on
decision making is a great for the imms' self confidence. And you never
know who might have a really good idea you want to use.
 
 3.) As imms working for an IMP, you -have- to be able to see past the
outside and through their imm characters. If the IMP is not around very
much, then you know decisions aren't being made as readily as they
should be.  Good IMPs should log every day, because they are the runners
of the mud. There's nothing worse than being a builder and need an IMP
decision and they aren't around until two days later. No mud can work
very well in the development process without leadership.
 
 Another thing with IMPs is to ask who people are that you're working
with. Eitehr ask them directly or ask the IMP who all works here.  They
should tell you where they are from, if they are mudders or ooc friends,
etc. If these builders you work with only goof around, perhaps nothing
is getting done. Ask the IMP sometimes about what's been changing in
code or area setups, what's new, if they don't post notes about that
already. An ecample of bad IMP leadership is one who gives friends more
benefits then the workers.  Avoid that at all costs.
 
 4.) Recognition of work. IMPs have to be fair in who they promote and
how they decide it. Someone who builds one area and logs half the time
another builder does who has built 5 areas should be given more
consideration on how they are given treatment.  I like the ideas of imm
level advancement based on work and input into the mud. Think about an
system where imms can 'level' by getting projects done. Just like
characters leveling with exp, imms can level through work. Nothing is
worse than putting time and effort in and not get credit for your work,
or people don't acknowledge your effort.
 
 5.) Imm and Mortal relations. Treat everyone the same. Do not let imms
give special treatment to anyone. Newbies and veterans alike, should be
given the attention they need, when needed. Newbies will need to have
questions answered, and old players will have problems with rules and
the like. the whole point of building a mud is to let others enjoy the
mud experience, and stay. If imms harass, or push mortals around, it
leaves a negative impact on the mud's image, and the playerbase will not
increase as fast, if at all, when imms appear to be jerks. Every mortal
that asks something should be answered. If they are bugging you, that is
what Wizi is for. If you have work to do, ignore the stupid questions,
and talk to important ones individually. There is no reason to type in
the tone of keyboard that makes you sound aggrivated to answer
questions. You're trying to keep player base, not kill it, remember?
Keep communication open. Even if you curse at your screen at their
stupidity, don't show that through text. Ever.
 
 Remember that ims are there to help characters out. If you add features
that can stop players' ability to play, like deceasing and retiring,
there needs to be many safe guards against it. If the staff says "Oh
wells", this is a terrible thing to do to players who spend time and
accidently have something bad happen. Player base.  Not Player killing.
 
 6.) Don't change rules without re-embersing players that will lose
things in this change. This might be changes in code where people high
levels lose HP or mana. Let them complain all they want, but consider
giving them something for their losses. Player base. Remember? Lots of
people spend thousands of hours on their character. You don't want them
leaving because of an imm decision that will change the way their
character works.
 
 7.) Don't expect builders to be around every day for 5 hours each day.
Don't be unrealistic. It's better to have an imm building a slow one
area per month+ than not at all. And the pressure is less. Building is
not a paying job, so don't force builders to work too much. Ask them to
work say an hour a day to be productive, but never less than logging
once a week to check baords. Make sure they also know that inactive imms
won't e given very good praise. Work = Privilages. Offer RP to those
that get a minimum amount of work done. Some people think that because
they are an imm they get to goof around. Bad news.
 
 8.) Have future ideas ready to IMP. Boring, lame muds reach this when
nothing new comes up. Always try and add new areas. New mud experience =
more players Wink
 
 These are the things I often see relatively good muds lack in. Bad muds
are even worse. Keep all, ALL, of these in mind when trying to manage a
mud. These are the biggest things I can suggest without being to
speicific Wink
